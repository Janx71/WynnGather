# Wynncraft Gathering Helper

## A Forge 1.12.2 Mod Made for Making Wynncraft Gathering easier

This Project will help you To gather by giving you useful information as an info panel on your screen as by highlighting specific nodes to give you real-time information about XP gain, node regeneration time and more. Thanks to Kyykek (Kyyken on Github) for helping me with this project.

* Shows The Material Type you are gathering.
* Shows the time to indicate how long you have been gathering.
* Shows the number of resource nodes you have mined in your session.
* Shows you how many nodes you mine per minute.
* Shows the percentage of XP missing for your next level.
* Shows how much gathering XP you make per hour.
* Shows the progress of your current node while mining.
* Nodes will change color to indicate regeneration time.
* Visibility of nodes increased dramatically.

# Known Bugs
* Woodcutting is still a complete mess. Some nodes are not at the right place, some don't show up at all, some are double.
* Wynncraft sometimes doesn't load a crucial element, which can lead to some nodes not being rendered
* Changing profession will not reset XP/h and other stats
* Double gathering speed still breaks everything progress related
 
# In Progress
* Info for T3 Materials
* Info for Tool durability
* Fix woodcutting
